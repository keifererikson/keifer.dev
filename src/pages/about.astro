        <div class="content">
          <p class="pb-4">
            Ever since I was a child, I've been passionate about technology. I
            used to disassemble my electronic toys to understand how they
            worked, tinkering and rebuilding them. My early days were spent in
            front of an old DOS computer, marveling at its black screen and
            green text.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I've programmed on and off for most of my life, I fully committed
            to this passion by enrolling in the Computer Software Development program
            at NAIT. I graduated in April 2025, with a 4.0 GPA and a 98.47% average.
            When I'm not at the keyboard, my life is full of new adventures as a proud father 
            since June 2025.

        <h2 class="section-title">My Journey</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="pb-4">
            My path to software development wasn't a straight line, but every
            role prepared me for it. My time as a Lead Lab Technician honed my skills
            in diagnostics, server management, and problem solving. My experience in
            commercial roofing taught me reliability, teamwork, and the grit to see
            a complex project through to completion under tight deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've channeled this diverse experience into my true passion:
            architecting and building full-stack applications. My capstone project, 
            an AI-Powered Event Grouping enterprise tool, allowed me to lead a 
            team of four and design a provider-agnostic Python backend, with a modern Next.js
            dashboard. To prove my understanding of these concepts, I built the AI Playground,
            a public, cleanroom implementation of that core architecture.
